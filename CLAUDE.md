# CLAUDE.md - Guidelines for menio codebase

## Build/Lint/Test Commands

- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint
- `pnpm format` - Format code with Prettier
- `pnpm type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm test` - Run all Jest tests
- `pnpm test -- -t "test name"` - Run specific test by name
- `pnpm test -- path/to/file.test.tsx` - Run tests in specific file
- `pnpm validate:translations` - Validate i18n translation files
- `pnpm validate:i18n` - Validate i18n files and run ESLint

## Code Style

- **Formatting**: Use Prettier with semi:false, singleQuote:true, printWidth:80
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with @/ prefix (e.g., `import Component from '@/components/Component'`)
- **Component Structure**: React functional components with explicit typing
- **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables
- **Testing**: Use React Testing Library with Jest
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React state for UI
- **Loading States**:
  - Do not fake data for loading states
  - Instead, use skeleton components for loading states
  - Display dates in the user's local format using toLocaleDateString(undefined, options)
- **Internationalization**:
  - Use next-intl with JSON message files
  - Never use hardcoded string literals in JSX (use translations instead)
  - Always import navigation APIs from `@/i18n/routing` instead of Next.js modules
  - Use the typed translations: `import { useTranslations } from '@/i18n/useTypedTranslations'`
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **TypeScript**:
  - Avoid using any type, use type inference when possible
  - Never update database.types.ts file manually, let supabase generate it
- **Database**:
  - For now you can update migrations, it's not online yet
